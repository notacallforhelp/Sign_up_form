# Sign_up_form

It is just a dummy website mimicking the Sign Up page of typical services
where they ask for Personal Details and such.

This project helped me practice many aspects of web development such as:
1. Flexbox
2. Using hard resets in CSS
3. The concept of absolutely positioning an element inside a relative element
4. Using self hosted fonts
5. Creating a basic input form
6. Using minimal validations for input submission
7. Using visual cues for indicating invalidity of input forms
